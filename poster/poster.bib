years. Within this report, {AEI} has provided recommendations on how to most effectively meet
the anticipated energy demands of the campus in an environmentally responsible manner.
While this effort was started and lead by the Facilities and Services Division, key campus
stakeholders have played a critical role in the development and finalization of this report. This
effort culminated in the attached report and recommendations, which were formally approved by
the Chancellor’s Capital Review Committee on September 23, 2015.
It has been a pleasure to have participated in the development of this important plan, and the
collective effort of all parties involved is greatly appreciated.},
